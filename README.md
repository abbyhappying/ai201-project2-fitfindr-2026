     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->



---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:**Finds listings that match the description keywords, filters them by optional size and price ceiling, and returns them ranked by keyword overlap.
- **Inputs:**
description (str)

size (str | None)

max_price (float | None)
- **Returns:** list[dict], where each dict contains id, title, description, category, style_tags (list), size, condition, price (float), colors (list), brand (str or None), platform.
- **When it has nothing:**
Returns an empty list [] when nothing matches — it does not raise an exception.

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:**
Asks the model for one or two outfits built around the new item. It uses the user's wardrobe pieces when they exist and general styling ideas when they don't.
- **Inputs:**
new_item (dict)  wardrobe (dict)
- **Returns:**
a non-empty str. With a populated wardrobe, it names specific pieces the user owns. With an empty one, it gives general ideas built on common basics and says so.
- **When it has nothing:**
When wardrobe["items"] is empty, suggest_outfit still calls the model, asking for general styling ideas built around the item using common basics. The returned text opens with a short sentence noting that the wardrobe is empty, then gives one or two general outfits. It never raises and never returns an empty string.

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:**
Writes a short social-post-style caption about the find, based on the outfit suggestion and the item.
- **Inputs:**
outfit (str): the output of suggest_outfit.
new_item (dict)
- **Returns:**
str, a fit card caption
- **When it has nothing:**
if outfit is empty or whitespace, it returns a descriptive message string ("No outfit suggestion provided, so no fit card was created.") without calling the model and without raising error.

## Planning Loop


**Branch rule:**
1. Call search_listings with the user's description, size, and price.
2. If the result is empty: set session["error"] to a message that names what was searched and which filters were applied, and add a hint such as "try a higher price or a different size". Then stop and return the session. Don't call either model tool.

3. Otherwise:
   - Store session["search_results"][0] in session["selected_item"].
   - Call suggest_outfit(session["selected_item"], session["wardrobe"]),
     reading the item back out of the session.
   - Store the result in session["outfit_suggestion"].

4. Call create_fit_card(session["outfit_suggestion"], session["selected_item"]),
   store the result in session["fit_card"].

5. Return the session.

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:**
The query is parsed with regular expressions. A price ceiling is extracted from phrases like "under $30", "below 30", or "max $30". A size is extracted from phrases like "size M" or "in size XL". Whatever remains, with those phrases removed, becomes the description passed to search_listings. If no price or size phrase is found, those arguments are None.

**What moves through the session:**

1. query: the raw user text, kept for the record and for error messages.
2. parsed: extracted description, size, max_price: the parsed values, so you can see what the parser actually extracted. This is the first place to look when search results seem wrong.
3. search_results: the list returned by search_listings.
4. selected_item: search_results[0], the listing the rest of the run is built on.
5. wardrobe: the wardrobe passed in, so the record shows which one was used.
6. outfit_suggestion: the string from suggest_outfit.
7. fit_card: the string from create_fit_card.
8. error: empty unless the loop stopped early, in which case it holds the user-facing message.

## Sample Run



**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask 'vintage graphic tee under $30'

```
Found:    Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print — $18.0 on depop

  Outfit:   **Outfit 1: Y2K Streetwear**
Pair the baby tee with your **Baggy straight-leg jeans, dark wash** for a classic early 2000s proportion play—fitted on top and loose on the bottom. Layer the **Vintage black denim jacket** on top and finish with your **Chunky white sneakers** and **Black crossbody bag**.

**Outfit 2: Casual Contrast**
Tuck the tee into your **Wide-leg khaki trousers** to highlight the cropped fit and mix the pink and purple tones with earthy tan. Throw on the **Black cropped zip hoodie** open over it, and ground the look with your **Black combat boots**.

  Fit card: Just scored this dreamy butterfly baby tee on depop for only eighteen bucks and I am obsessed withthe pink and purple print. I'm leaning into total Y2K streetwear today by pairing the fitted crop with baggy dark-wash jeans and chunky white sneakers. It gives me major early 2000s mall-rat energy in the best way possible. #y2kstyle #depopfinds

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 4 — THE TEST ═══════════════════════

     Don't fill these in during unit 3.

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
